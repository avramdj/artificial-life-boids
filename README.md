# Artificial life simulation: Boids

Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.

 The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

  * **separation**: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
  * **alignment**: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
  * **cohesion**: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
